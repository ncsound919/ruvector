# ADR-135: MinCut Decompiler with RVF Witness Chains

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-04-02

## Context

JavaScript bundle decompilation is an unsolved problem in the reverse-engineering
toolchain. Existing tools (e.g., `webcrack`, `source-map-explorer`) either require
the original source map or rely on heuristic name guessing with no provenance
guarantee. We need a decompiler that:

1. Reconstructs module boundaries from a single minified bundle.
2. Infers original variable/function names with confidence scoring.
3. Produces standard V3 source maps loadable in browser DevTools.
4. Provides cryptographic proof that every output byte derives from the input.

## Decision

We will create `ruvector-decompiler`, a Rust crate implementing a five-phase
decompilation pipeline:

### Phase 1 -- AST Parsing + Reference Graph Construction

A regex-based parser extracts top-level declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`,
`function`, `class`) and builds a weighted reference graph. Nodes are
declarations; edges are cross-references weighted by frequency. String literals
and property accesses are attached as metadata.

### Phase 2 -- MinCut Module Boundary Detection

The reference graph is fed to `ruvector-mincut`'s `GraphPartitioner`, which uses
recursive bisection to find natural module boundaries where coupling is lowest.
Each resulting partition is a reconstructed module.

### Phase 3 -- Name Inference with Confidence Scoring

Inferred names are derived from:

- **String context** (HIGH confidence >0.9): direct string literal matches
  (e.g., `"tools/call"` implies MCP-related).
- **Property correlation** (MEDIUM 0.6--0.9): property names like `.permission`,
  `.toolName` suggest purpose.
- **Structural heuristics** (LOW <0.6): positional or structural evidence only.

Inference patterns are stored for self-learning improvement across runs.

### Phase 4 -- Source Map Generation

Standard V3 source maps (VLQ-encoded) are generated per module, mapping
beautified output positions back to original minified positions. Inferred names
populate the `names` array.

### Phase 5 -- RVF Witness Chain

A Merkle-style witness chain proves provenance:

- SHAKE-256 hash of the original bundle.
- SHAKE-256 hash of each extracted module (keyed by byte range).
- Merkle root of all module hashes.
- Inferred-names hash per module.

This chain is compatible with the RVF `WITNESS_SEG` format.

## Crate Structure

```
crates/ruvector-decompiler/
  Cargo.toml
  src/
    lib.rs           -- Public API (decompile entry point)
    parser.rs        -- Regex-based JS bundle parser
    graph.rs         -- Reference graph construction
    partitioner.rs   -- MinCut module boundary detection
    inferrer.rs      -- Name inference with confidence scoring
    sourcemap.rs     -- V3 source map generation (VLQ)
    beautifier.rs    -- Code beautification / pretty-printing
    witness.rs       -- RVF witness chain (SHAKE-256 Merkle)
    types.rs         -- Core domain types
    error.rs         -- Error types (thiserror)
  tests/
    integration.rs   -- End-to-end test with sample minified JS
```

## Dependencies

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `ruvector-mincut` (path) | Graph partitioning via recursive bisection |
| `sha3` | SHAKE-256 hashing for witness chain |
| `serde` + `serde_json` | Source map serialization |
| `regex` | Declaration and reference extraction |
| `thiserror` | Ergonomic error types |

## Consequences

### Positive

- First decompiler with cryptographic provenance (witness chains).
- MinCut partitioning produces higher-quality module boundaries than heuristic
  splitting.
- Confidence-scored name inference lets consumers filter by reliability.
- V3 source maps integrate directly with browser DevTools.

### Negative

- Regex-based parsing will miss edge cases in heavily obfuscated bundles.
- MinCut assumes the reference graph accurately captures module coupling.
- Name inference accuracy depends on string literal density in the bundle.

### Risks

- Very large bundles (>10 MB) may be slow without streaming parsing.
- Minifiers that inline everything reduce reference graph signal.

## Ground-Truth Validation Methodology

### Approach

Each test fixture consists of a known original JS source and its hand-minified
equivalent. The decompiler runs on the minified version and output is compared
against ground truth using the following metrics:

- **Declaration recovery**: percentage of original declarations found.
- **Name accuracy**: fuzzy match between inferred names and known original
  names (keyword overlap).
- **Module boundary accuracy**: how closely partitions match the original
  module structure (number of modules, grouping of related declarations).
- **Witness chain validity**: the Merkle chain must self-verify.

### Fixtures

| Fixture | Description | Declarations | Modules |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `fixture-express` | Express-like HTTP framework | 5 | 3 |
| `fixture-mcp-server` | MCP server with tool registry | 4 | 2 |
| `fixture-react-component` | React-like hooks + class component | 3 | 2 |
| `fixture-multi-module` | Math + string + composition modules | 7 | 3 |
| `fixture-tools-bundle` | Tool definitions with known names | 4 | 2 |

### Accuracy Targets

- **Name recovery**: >60% accuracy on known projects (fuzzy match).
- **Module boundary**: >80% accuracy (correct partition count).
- **Zero false positives at HIGH confidence** (>0.9): any name inferred at
  HIGH confidence must correspond to a real pattern in the original source.

### Self-Learning Feedback Loop

The `learn_from_ground_truth()` function in `inferrer.rs` takes feedback from
ground-truth comparisons and extracts successful/failed inference patterns.
These patterns can be:

1. Logged for analysis.
2. Fed into SONA for cross-run learning.
3. Used to expand or prune the static `KNOWN_PATTERNS` table.
